Medium Risk:
●	The vendor can not catch the schedule as they committed (2-3 times)
●	Finishing is not good → wash up → Delay the sample process (2-3 times)
●	White wood material can not achieve finish per design's intention

📈 Risk Assessment Summary
Supply Chain Risk Categories:
Competitor Impact Risks:
When suppliers allocate more capacity to competitors, it directly affects Ashley's supply security. The risk escalates from having adequate safety stock coverage to compromising shippable inventory levels.
Performance & Penalty Risks:
Supplier delivery performance below expectations triggers penalty mechanisms. Repeated penalties indicate systemic issues requiring immediate attention and potential supplier replacement.
Relationship & Continuity Risks:
Supplier cooperation levels indicate long-term partnership viability. From inflexible planning to complete business termination, these risks require proactive relationship management and contingency planning.
Force Majeure & Emergency Risks:
External factors beyond normal business operations that can completely disrupt supply chains, requiring immediate crisis management and alternative sourcing strategies.
